# metagenomes_NEON

This repository contains code for downloading and processing shotgun metagenomics data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). This accompanies a tutorial for processing the raw reads.

Two BLAST analyses are included in the tutorial: one focuses on N-cycling genes, and the other on antibiotic resistance genes. There are scripts here for parsing the BLAST output (in Python), writing it to a CSV file, then visualizing the results in R.
