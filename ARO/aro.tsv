ARO:3000000	determinant of antibiotic resistance	A mutation, single nucleotide polymorphism, gene, or gene product that confers antibiotic resistance.	36009
ARO:3000001	beta-lactamase	Beta-lactamases are enzymes (EC 3.5.2.6) produced by some bacteria and are responsible for their resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillins, cephalosporins (are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase), cephamycins, and carbapenems (ertapenem). These antibiotics have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a beta-lactam. The lactamase enzyme breaks that ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties. Beta-lactam antibiotics are typically used to treat a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative organisms are usually secreted.	36010

ARO:3000004	class B (metallo-) beta-lactamase	Ambler Class B beta-lactamases are the metallo-beta-lactamases.  These enzymes possess one or two zinc ions in the active site, which are used to orient a hydroxide nucleophile to attack the carbonyl on a beta-lactam ring.  There are currently no inhibitors in late-stage development for these relatively new beta-lactamases.	36013
ARO:3000005	vanD	VanD is a D-Ala-D-Ala ligase homolog similar to VanA, and can synthesize D-Ala-D-Lac, an alternative substrate for peptidoglycan synthesis that reduces vancomycin binding affinity. It is associated with both vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance.	36014
ARO:3000006	vanH	VanH is a D-specific alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase that synthesizes D-lactate. D-lactate is incorporated into the end of the peptidoglycan subunits, decreasing vancomycin binding affinity.	36015
ARO:3000007	beta-lactam antibiotic	Beta-lactam antibiotics are a broad class of antibiotics that include penams (penicillin derivatives), cephems (cephalosporins), monobactams, and carbapenems. These antibiotic agents contain a beta-lactam nucleus in its molecular structure. They are the most widely-used group of antibiotics.	36016
ARO:3000008	penam	Penams, often referred to as penicillins, are a group of antibiotics derived from Penicillium fungi. Penicillin antibiotics are historically significant because they are the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases such as syphilis and Staphylococcus infections. Penicillins are still widely used today, though many types of bacteria are now resistant. All penicillins are beta-lactam antibiotics in the penam sub-group, and are used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually Gram-positive, organisms.	36017

ARO:3000013	vanB	VanB is a D-Ala-D-Ala ligase homolog similar to VanA, and can synthesize D-Ala-D-Lac, an alternative substrate for peptidoglycan synthesis that reduces vancomycin binding affinity. It has been isolated from VREs. It is associated with vancomycin resistance, but not teicoplanin resistance.	36022
ARO:3000014	TEM beta-lactamase	TEM-1 is the most commonly-encountered beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria. Up to 90% of ampicillin resistance in E. coli is due to the production of TEM-1. Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, they are also found in other species of gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the ESBL phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to b-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid.  Although the inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases are not ESBLs, they are often discussed with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM beta-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of E. coli, but also some strains of K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, P. mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii. Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by clavulanic acid and sulbactam, thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam-lactamase inhibitor combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Co-amoxiclav), ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin/sulbactam, they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by tazobactam and subsequently the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam, although resistance has been described.	36023
ARO:3000015	SHV beta-lactamase	SHV-1 shares 68 percent of its amino acids with TEM-1 and has a similar overall structure. The SHV-1 beta-lactamase is most commonly found in K. pneumoniae and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in this species. ESBLs in this family also have amino acid changes around the active site, most commonly at positions 238 or 238 and 240. More than 60 SHV varieties are known.	36024
ARO:3000016	CTX-M beta-lactamase	These enzymes were named for their greater activity against cefotaxime than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (eg, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or cefepime). Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally found on the chromosome of Kluyvera species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they show only approximately 40% identity with these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases. Despite their name, a few are more active on ceftazidime than cefotaxime.  CTX-M-15 was recently found in bacterial strains expressing NDM-1 and were responsible for resistance to aztreonam.	36025
ARO:3000017	OXA beta-lactamase	OXA beta-lactamases were long recognized as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d. The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.	36026
ARO:3000018	IMI beta-lactamase	IMI beta-lactamases are a group of TEM-1-like beta-lactamase that are known to hydrolyze imipenem. IMI beta-lactamases are inhibited by clavulanic acid and tazobactam.	36027

AmpC type beta-lactamases may also be carried on plasmids. AmpC beta-lactamases, in contrast to ESBLs, hydrolyse broad and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cephamycins as well as to oxyimino-beta-lactams) but are not inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid.	36215

Elfamycins defined by their target (EF-Tu), rather than a conserved chemical backbone. Elfamycins follow two mechanisms to disrupt protein synthesis: 1. kirromycins and enacyloxin fix EF-Tu in the GTP bound conformation and lock EF-Tu onto the ribosome, and 2. pulvomycin and GE2270 cover the binding site of aa-tRNA disallowing EF-Tu from being charged with aa-tRNA.

It is an open question whether enacyloxin IIa actually belongs to the kirromycin-like group of elfamycins due to their high similarity.	37641
